## **Patient** {#patient}

### **Description**

A non-expert user, such as a patient or caregiver, seeking to understand a disease affecting themselves, a family member or a friend. They want to explore biomedical data to gain insights into disease mechanisms, treatment options, and ongoing research. They rely on intuitive tools to make complex scientific data accessible and actionable.

### **Assumptions**

- Has little to no technical background in biomedical research, bioinformatics, or computational tools.
- Relies on intuitive interfaces and guided exploration to interact with the data.
- Might have low data and visualization literacy.
- May be unfamiliar with technical terminology and data structures used in biomedical repositories.
- Primarily interested in information related to diagnosis, treatment, and emerging research.
- May feel overwhelmed by large datasets and complex scientific literature.
- Relies on visual representations and summaries rather than raw data tables or technical reports.
- Seeks trustworthy, well-sourced information from reputable medical and scientific organizations.

### **Needs/Wants**

- **Clear, Jargon-Free Explanations**: Needs clear, jargon-free explanations of biomedical concepts, such as disease pathology, biomarkers, and available treatments related to their condition.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Need interactive visualizations to explore disease mechanisms, treatments, and potential research studies.
- **Guided Quiries**: Need guided queries to navigate relevant datasets, including clinical and molecular information.
- **Pre-structured Questions and Prompts**: Benefits from pre-structured questions and prompts that help them access relevant clinical and molecular datasets without requiring prior knowledge of data structures.
- **Trusted References**: Need references to trusted sources (e.g., research articles, clinical guidelines) for further reading.
- **Automated Summaries**: Values the ability to generate automated summaries of relevant findings from chat interactions to aid decision-making and discussions with healthcare providers.
- **Intuitive Visual Representations**: Requires intuitive visual representations (e.g., disease pathways, genomic associations, treatment comparisons) to explore complex biomedical relationships.
