## **Data Contributor** {#data-contributor}

### **Description**

A researcher, institution, or organization that generates and shares biomedical data, ensuring it meets established standards for accessibility, interoperability, and reproducibility. Their primary goal is to contribute high-quality datasets that can be used by other researchers, educators, and clinicians while adhering to best practices in data curation and sharing.

**Assumptions**

- Has expertise in biomedical research, data generation, and computational methodologies.
- Understands the importance of data quality, metadata completeness, and adherence to ontological standards.
- May contribute data as part of a funding or institutional requirement to support open science and reproducibility.
- Uses biomedical data repositories as both a contributor and a consumer, requiring bidirectional access to datasets.

### **Needs/Wants**

- **Streamlined Submission Workflows**: Requires an intuitive, well-documented submission process with clear metadata and formatting guidelines to minimize errors and inefficiencies.
- **Ontology Mapping & Standardization**: Needs tools to ensure data is correctly mapped to anatomical, molecular, and functional ontologies for consistency and interoperability.
- **Metadata & File Format Compliance**: Seeks well-defined metadata standards and file format requirements for submitting data and influencing emerging standards in the field.
- **Data Validation & Quality Control**: Requires automated checks or downloadable validation tools to verify data integrity before submission.
- **Bidirectional Data Access**: Needs the ability to download datasets from the repository to compare with their own data, validate submission workflows, or refine data-sharing processes.
- **Long-Term Data Accessibility**: Values sustainable storage and access models to ensure data remains available and useful to the scientific community over time.
- **Collaboration & Community Engagement**: May participate in efforts to shape data-sharing policies, contribute to evolving standards, and engage with the user community to improve data usability.
