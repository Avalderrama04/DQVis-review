These personas were developed based on personas developed for several NIH-funded data resources such as the NIH Kidney Precision Medicine Project, the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem Project, and the NIH Human Biomolecular Atlas Program, as well as general user research, including user interviews focusing on persona development, workshops, and other related work (e.g., our definitions of user personas in genomics research [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681582](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681582)).
