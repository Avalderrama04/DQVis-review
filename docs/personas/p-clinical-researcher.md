## **Clinical Researcher** {#clinical-researcher}

### **Description**

A medical or clinical expert who uses biomedical data to understand disease mechanisms, validate patient diagnoses, and assess treatment options. They have strong domain knowledge in biology and medicine but limited experience with programming or command-line tools. They prefer intuitive, point-and-click interfaces for accessing and interpreting clinical and molecular datasets. They are not familiar with the command line or know any programming languages.

**Assumptions**

- Has expertise in a specific medical or clinical research area but limited computational training.
- Comfortable using web-based interfaces, spreadsheets, and graphical tools but not command-line environments or scripting languages.
- Works in a multidisciplinary environment, often collaborating with data scientists or bioinformaticians who handle advanced data processing.

### **Needs/Wants**

- **Access to High-Quality Reference Dataset**s: Requires well-curated datasets for clinical validation, benchmarking, and research applications.
- **User-Friendly Data Interaction**: Prefers intuitive, web-based tools that allow seamless exploration of biomedical data without requiring programming skills.
- **Human-Readable Data Formats**: Needs structured data in an easily interpretable format (e.g., tables, spreadsheets) for direct analysis and comparison.
- **Data Conversion & Collaboration**: May need tools to transform human-readable data into machine-readable formats for collaboration with data scientists or computational researchers.
- **Data Quality & Assurance Transparency**: Requires detailed metadata on dataset provenance, quality control metrics, and validation procedures to ensure reliability.
- **Clinical Validation & Decision Support**: Uses biomedical data to support clinical conclusions, evaluate potential biomarkers, and refine treatment strategies.
- **Integration with Scientific Literature & Guidelines**: Values datasets linked to research studies, clinical guidelines, and regulatory references for contextual insights.
