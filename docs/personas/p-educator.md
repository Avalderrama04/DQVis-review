## **Educator**

### **Description**

An instructor or professor teaching biomedical concepts at various levels, including high school, undergraduate, graduate, and medical training. They integrate biomedical data into their lessons to enhance student understanding, using it for demonstrations, case studies, and hands-on learning activities. Some educators also use datasets for experiments or instructional research where real-world data is essential but otherwise difficult to obtain.

**Assumptions**

- Has a strong background in biology, medicine, or a related field but may not specialize in computational tools or bioinformatics.
- May teach students with varying levels of expertise, requiring materials that can be adjusted in complexity.
- Prefers engaging, interactive content that facilitates knowledge retention and student participation.
- May have limited institutional access to certain types of biomedical data, making public repositories a valuable resource.

### **Needs/Wants**

- **Curated Datasets for Teaching:** Requires well-organized datasets with clear annotations and contextual explanations for use in lectures and lab exercises.
- **Engaging Visualizations & Interactive Models**: Needs interactive tools (e.g., pathway diagrams, heatmaps, 3D molecular structures) to help students grasp complex biological relationships.
- **Access to Rare or Exclusive Data**: Requires high-quality, real-world datasets to conduct instructional demonstrations or case studies that arenâ€™t feasible in a traditional lab setting.
- **Flexible Data Exploration**: Values tools that allow for guided and open-ended exploration, enabling students to form and test hypotheses.
- **Reference & Demonstration Materials**: Needs access to datasets to illustrate key biological and biomedical concepts, either through static figures or dynamic models.
- **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Prefers an intuitive system that requires minimal setup, allowing students to engage with data without extensive computational training.
- **Support for Experimentation**: In some cases, may use biomedical data as a substitute for physical experiments, mainly when access to lab-based experiments is limited.
- **Integration with Scientific Literature**: Benefits from built-in references to primary research articles and authoritative sources to support classroom discussions.
