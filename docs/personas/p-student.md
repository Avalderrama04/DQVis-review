## **Student** {#student}

### **Description**

A student at the undergraduate or graduate level who uses biomedical data to enhance their understanding of molecular and cellular processes within a specific tissue type or biological system. Their primary goal is learning rather than conducting original research. They may use the data for coursework, presentations, or self-guided study, requiring accessible and well-structured resources.  
**Assumptions**

- Has a basic to intermediate understanding of biological concepts but may not be proficient in bioinformatics or computational analysis.
- Likely accessing biomedical databases to supplement coursework, complete assignments, or prepare presentations.
- Needs data that are already curated and annotated, rather than raw datasets requiring extensive preprocessing.
- May be unfamiliar with command-line tools, programming languages, or advanced statistical methods.
- Benefits from guided exploration rather than open-ended data querying.
- Prefers interactive, visually engaging tools over purely text-based resources.

### **Needs/Wants**

- **Access to Well-Annotated, High-Quality Data**: Requires structured datasets with clear metadata, explanations, and contextual information to support learning.
- **Intuitive Interfaces & Visualizations**: Needs user-friendly tools to explore molecular and cellular data through interactive charts, pathway diagrams, and 3D models.
- **Structured Data for Learning**: Prefers pre-organized datasets that align with common biological themes (e.g., tissue types, disease models, molecular pathways).
- **Simplified Data Access**: Requires access to datasets without needing advanced coding or computational skills, with the option to download data in standard formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).
- **Guided Exploration & Tutorials**: Benefits from built-in explanations, tutorials, and example queries to help navigate complex datasets.
- **Presentation-Ready Content**: Needs the ability to export visualizations and key findings for use in academic presentations, reports, or study materials.
- **Cross-Referencing with Scientific Literature**: Values integrated links to relevant research papers, reviews, and reference databases for deeper exploration.
