## **Experimental Biologist**

### **Description**

An experimental biologist leverages biomedical data to inform and guide physical experiments on specific tissue types. They use data to validate experimental results, generate new research hypotheses, and support applications for funding or publications. While their expertise lies in biological experimentation and laboratory techniques, they rely on intuitive, graphical interfaces to interact with data.

### **Assumptions**

- Possesses a strong foundation in biological concepts and experimental methodologies.
- Has limited programming or computational skills and prefers graphical user interfaces and spreadsheets.
- Prioritizes direct, visually intuitive access to data that can be easily compared with laboratory results.
- Values data sources that provide comprehensive, well-annotated reference information for normal tissues and cellular models.
- Seeks tools that facilitate quick and straightforward exploration of biomedical data without requiring advanced computational expertise.

### **Needs/Wants**

- **Accessible Comparative Data**: Needs to quickly find and access tissue or cellular datasets for comparison against their own experimental data.
- **Compatible Data Formats**: Requires the ability to download datasets in formats that are compatible with local analysis tools or use the portalâ€™s built-in visualization and analysis features.
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Uses data to develop and refine hypotheses, supporting research studies, publication efforts, and grant applications.
- **3D Models & 2D Samples**: May need access to high-quality 3D models and 2D visual representations to better understand cellular interactions and tissue structures.
- **Customizable Visualization Options**: Requires interactive tools that allow enabling or disabling specific technologies or data layers to explore different aspects of cellular interactions.
- **Data Faceting Based on Metadata**: Needs the ability to filter or facet datasets based on available metadata attributes (such as tissue type, experimental conditions, or sample origin) to focus on the most relevant data for their experiments.
