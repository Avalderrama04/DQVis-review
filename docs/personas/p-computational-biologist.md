## **Computational Biologist** {#computational-biologist}

### **Description**

A computational biologist leverages biomedical data to develop models, run simulations, and perform large-scale analyses to address complex biological questions. Proficient in programming languages like Python, R, and MATLAB, they integrate datasets from multiple sources to drive comprehensive computational investigations.

### **Assumptions**

- Possesses strong computational and programming skills, including proficiency in Python, R, MATLAB, and relevant bioinformatics tools.
- Regularly integrates and analyzes data from diverse sources for comprehensive studies.
- Comfortable with command-line interfaces, scripting, and automated workflows.
- Understands the critical importance of metadata, documentation, and reproducibility in scientific research.
- Often works in multidisciplinary teams, collaborating with biologists, clinicians, and data scientists.

### **Needs/Wants**

- **Efficient Data Access**: Requires fast, searchable access to high-quality tissue and cellular datasets to support computational analyses.
- **Machine-Readable Formats**: Needs datasets available in formats such as CSV, JSON, or HDF5 to seamlessly integrate with local pipelines or utilize built-in analysis tools.
- **Comprehensive Metadata & Documentation**: Must have detailed metadata and thorough documentation to ensure reproducibility and maintain data integrity across analyses.
- **Advanced Visualization Tools**: Seeks robust, interactive visualization capabilities to explore complex data structures and derive actionable insights.
- **APIs & Bulk Data Access**: Requires APIs or bulk download options to facilitate large-scale data processing and integration into automated workflows.
- **Integration with Computational Tools**: Benefits from compatibility with common computational frameworks and libraries to streamline model development and simulation processes.
